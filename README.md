♻️Waste Classification for Recycling using CNN

🧩Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-based image classification system that automatically identifies different types of waste — such as Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, Cardboard, and Trash.
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system promotes automated waste segregation, enabling more efficient recycling and contributing to environmental sustainability.

🎯Objective
Develop a deep learning model capable of classifying waste images accurately.
Reduce human involvement and errors in waste segregation.
Support recycling and circular economy initiatives through automation.

🌍Sustainability Impact

This project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, focusing on:
Encouraging recycling and reusability of materials.
Reducing waste contamination in recycling processes.
Promoting cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable cities.
