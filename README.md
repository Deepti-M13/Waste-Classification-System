# Week-1
Waste Classification for Recycling using CNN

Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-based image classification system that automatically identifies different types of waste — such as Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, Cardboard, and Trash.
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system promotes automated waste segregation, enabling more efficient recycling and contributing to environmental sustainability.

Objective
Develop a deep learning model capable of classifying waste images accurately.
Reduce human involvement and errors in waste segregation.
Support recycling and circular economy initiatives through automation.

Sustainability Impact

This project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, focusing on:
Encouraging recycling and reusability of materials.
Reducing waste contamination in recycling processes.
Promoting cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable cities.
